Geode Puzzle,102,Nancy,"Hartford, CT","I am disappointed in this puzzle, and am already returning it a day after we received it.  For $65 I expect a premium feeling experience and colors that at least somewhat match the images on the website.  Both my son and I felt that the printing quality on the pieces wasn't particularly great and it didn't ""feel"" like the pieces were made of woodâ€”they could have been shaped out of plexi or some other material and it would have felt pretty much the same.  The blues on the actual puzzle were MUCH darker than the website shows, which I might have written off as the ""variance"" they warn about, except all the review photos fairly consistently show the much darker colors.  The fit of the pieces isn't snug, which is a significant part of the challenge in assembly but also added to feeling that is wasn't well crafted.  (This is our first wooden puzzle, so I'm not sure if the materials prevent a snugger feel or not). I was prepared having read the description and the reviews for a small puzzle, but it still ended up being smaller than expected.  The kicker was that our puzzle showed up missing multiple pieces.  

On the positive side, the puzzle was more challenging than I expected based on the size and piece count.  I'm a slow puzzler, and the estimate of about 11 hours someone else mentioned sounds about right for my skill level...maybe a little less once I got going.  My son is a more experienced puzzler, and after I'd gotten about 2/3rds of the edges assembled, he jumped in and finished what he could in maybe 3-4 hours.  So maybe 5 hours if he'd done it all himself?",2020-05-15,09:19:26,5.0,1,"disappointed puzzle already return day receive expect premium feeling experience color least somewhat match image website son felt printing quality piece particularly great feel like piece make woodâ€”they could shape plexi material would felt pretty much blue actual puzzle much darker website show might write variance warn except review photo fairly consistently show much darker color fit piece snug significant part challenge assembly also add feel well craft first wooden puzzle i'm sure material prevent snugger feel prepared read description review small puzzle still end small expected kicker puzzle show miss multiple piece

We even went ahead and made our own little ""morse code"" for fun! You also get to select what color your bond shows which is a great add on if you ask me. A bonus is that we can be connected to this AND a stereo/car radio via bluetooth without any interruption. The app is always getting better and they even just released the secret message chat! Super fun! With the app we count down the days until our next date and can repeat codes sent as a little reminder. It also lasts almost two days without charge which can be great if you are too busy and lose track of time before charging it again (the app also tells you how much battery is left).

World Map Coloring Tablecloth,427,Gma,"Madison, CT","When my 2 daughters and their families had to cancel their vacations due to Covid 19, these interactive, educational maps supplemented the research the kids had done in advance of their trips and gave them hours of ""pandemic"" activities. The kids also love how the colors just slide off when a color change is needed. I will be purchasing the United States maps next!  I wish these maps had been available before I retired from teaching. My classes would have loved them and I can think of many related extension activities.

World Map Coloring Tablecloth,428,Trish Zeno,"Lynn, Massachusetts","This is a wonderful, unique gift with several interactive qualities engaging children to learn about our great big world, through an art form in which they'll spend more than just minutes rather hours coloring. My daughter and her husband reported to me that their children spent a great deal of time coloring, asking questions about the countries on the map, also this is an opportunity for family fun, as well as a distraction from technology. I then purchased the map of the US states and will color this with all three of my grandchildren when it arrives.",2020-07-15,18:57:04,5.0,1,wonderful unique gift several interactive quality engage child learn great big world art form they'll spend minute rather hour color daughter husband report child spent great deal time color ask question country map also opportunity family fun well distraction technology purchase map state color three grandchild arrives,0.039,0.576,0.385,0.9712,2,18

World Map Coloring Tablecloth,431,Mrs. Mommy,"Vail, AZ","So the good: it's beautiful, a fun learning tool, and my girls love it. The bad: I didn't read the actual dimensions on this product before purchasing, and that's on me, but this thing is laughably small. Really not a tablecloth so much as a supersized dinner napkin. We have a small dining table, seats four, and I have never purchased a tablecloth that I didn't have to hem. So it didn't even occur to me to make sure it'd be big enough. It is not big enough. Not even close. So it's just floating in the middle of my table like a weird tapestry. And again, didn't measure, my bad, but I have seen so very few tables that this would actually fully clothe that I feel a little misled.",2020-06-30,02:20:52,5.0,1,good beautiful fun learn tool girl love bad read actual dimension product purchase that's thing laughably small really tablecloth much supersized dinner napkin small din table seat four never purchase tablecloth hem even occur make sure it'd big enough big enough even close float middle table like weird tapestry measure bad see table would actually fully clothe feel little mislead,0.109,0.625,0.266,0.9118,1,2
